# File Organizer
##  what  are the requirements  to  do
- Files must be organized according to there type
- Like image should be go to the image folder or documents should go to the documents folder  and else
- There is few  thing to notice if there is already a type folder like  Document then we should  move file to that location
- One doubt since we are using Linux we have Document, Desktop , Music , Pictures, Videos already there

- Should we do this to them like moving file to them or create new one's  subfolder  in the current directory
for organizing that directory
